            <p>This report will give you a hopefully insightful overview of the media you've accumulated. It will
              help you understand the usage of your library and how the space on your hard drive is
              being utilized. Through a range of visualizations and data analysis, you will be able to see the
              relationships between different variables such as the types of media, the file sizes, and the timescale.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Library entries over time</h2>
            <p>This graph shows you the cumulative amount of movies and TV-shows you added over time. Note that this
            date represents the last modified time so if you updated files recently, they'll be listed as added recently.
            </p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../plots/me_o_t.jpg" alt="library entries over time">
            <p>You can clearly see how fast or slow your library increases over the years. Depending on what this plot
            looks like for you, this might mean different things: If the lines grow linearly, your library grows in
            a constant rate. So if you had 50 movies by the end of 2019, you'll have 100 movies by the end of 2020. If
            the lines grow exponentially, it shows that you've started out slowly but the more media you have, the more
            you want to add!

            <h2>Distribution of episodes</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how some shows just have so many more episodes than others? Now you can check for
            real! This plot shows the distribution of episodes for your shows. The x-axis describes the number of
            episodes, the y-axis the number of shows that have this many episodes.</p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../plots/dis_ep.jpg" alt="episode distribution">
            <p>{0}</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Movie releases</h2>
            <p>Next, let's look at some movie releases. Here you'll be able to see what year movies were released.
            This histogram works the same way as the last one. On the x-axis you can see the year of release and on the
            y-axis the amount of movies that were released that year. Note that if many movies were released in 1900
            that might indicate that you didn't specify the release year for your movies properly and the default
            value was set.</p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../plots/re_mo.jpg" alt="movie release years">
            <p>Are you a fan of old movies or do you prefer more recent movies?</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Word frequency</h2>
            <p>What words tend to appear more often in the names of the media you watch? Is it love? Or maybe death?
            This might indicate what kind of movie or show you're more interested in or more likely to click on based
            on it's title alone.</p>
            <table class="table table-sm">
              <tr>
                <th>Word</th>
                <th>Frequency</th>
              </tr>
                <tbody class="table-group-divider">
              <tr>
                <td>{1}</td>
                <td>{2}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>{3}</td>
                <td>{4}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>{5}</td>
                <td>{6}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>

              <tr>
                <td>{9}</td>
                <td>{10}</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Please note that many (but maybe not all) connection/filler words like "and", "or", "to" have been
            removed. These do not constitute to the title and are thus not relevant in this analysis.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Size comparison by filetype</h2>
            <p>Are some of your movies using certain fileformats larger than other movies? Are Matroska files (ending
              with mkv) larger than MPEG-4 files (ending with mp4)? They might be, because they tend to carry more data
              like higher quality video & audio streams or additional subtitle streams.
            </p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../plots/ft_s.jpg" alt="filetype to size">
            <p>This boxplot will show you the interquantile range (IQR) as the blue box you see with a green line somewhere
            inside, which depicts the median value. You'll also be able to see outilers as black circles, if there are
            any.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Quality scores</h2>
            <p>The quality score is a score that tries to determine the video quality of a TV-Show based on the length
            of the episodes, the file sizes and the amount of episodes. It can be described as the average size of each
            episode divided by the average length of episodes. This is then normalised to a value between 0 and 1.
            Note that while in practice this works quite well, it is not a perfect metric.</p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../plots/sc_an.jpg" alt="significant scores">
            <p>In this plot you can see all the scores for your TV-Shows with the highest scores annotated. These shows
            have a high ratio of file size to episode length, indicating higher bitrate, resolution or similar. While
            these scores are in relation to the other existing scores, you might want to consider compressing these
            shows in order to save storage space.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Movies and library size</h2>
            <p>Last but not least, let's look at the relation of the size of your library to the amount of media you
            have (currently only movies). This plot will show you the estimated growth as a dotted red line, with the
            actual growth as the blue line. The y-axis describes the total amount of space taken up by your library and
            the x-axis the amount of movies you have sorted by year.</p>
            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="../plots/m_t_f.jpg" alt="movies_to_size">
            <p>The dotted red line shows you how your library will grow expectedly. If the blue line deviates from this
            significantly, you can conclude that movies added at that point are different in their size. If the blue
            line is above the red line, your movies are bigger than expected and vice versa if the blue line is below
            the red line.</p>
